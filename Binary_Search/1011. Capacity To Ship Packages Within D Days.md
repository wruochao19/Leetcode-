## 1011. Capacity To Ship Packages Within D Days
A conveyor belt has packages that must be shipped from one port to another within days days.

The ith package on the conveyor belt has a weight of weights[i]. Each day, we load the ship with packages on the conveyor belt (in the order given by weights). We may not load more weight than the maximum weight capacity of the ship.

Return the least weight capacity of the ship that will result in all the packages on the conveyor belt being shipped within days days.

**Example 1**

```
Input: weights = [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10], days = 5
Output: 15
Explanation: A ship capacity of 15 is the minimum to ship all the packages in 5 days like this:
1st day: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5
2nd day: 6, 7
3rd day: 8
4th day: 9
5th day: 10

Note that the cargo must be shipped in the order given, so using a ship of capacity 14 and splitting the packages into parts like (2, 3, 4, 5), (1, 6, 7), (8), (9), (10) is not allowed.
```
**Example 2**

```
Input: weights = [3,2,2,4,1,4], days = 3
Output: 6
Explanation: A ship capacity of 6 is the minimum to ship all the packages in 3 days like this:
1st day: 3, 2
2nd day: 2, 4
3rd day: 1, 4
```

**Example 3**

```
Input: weights = [1,2,3,1,1], days = 4
Output: 3
Explanation:
1st day: 1
2nd day: 2
3rd day: 3
4th day: 1, 1
```


## 思路
由于要求按顺序装货，所以不需要考虑最佳情况。由题可知船的装载量最低为weights中的最大值，而船的装载量比“weights中所有元素之和”要大的时候只需1天即可装完所有货物。所以本题要求的船的最小装载量一定在“weights的最大值”与“weights中所有元素之和”之间。以下用maxWeight和sumWeight来表示。

理解了题意后解法就很简明了，只需要由maxWeight到sumWeight每个capacity都试一下能否在所指定的天数内完成运货，代码中该方法为“canBeTransfered”。假如返回true则当前capacity便是最小capacity。但如此一来时间复杂度会变得很大，于是这里使用二分法对处于maxWeight和sumWeight之间的所需capacity进行查找。

## 代码
```java
class Solution {
    public int shipWithinDays(int[] weights, int days) {
        int number = weights.length;
        int maxWeight = weights[0];
        int sumWeight = 0;
        for(int i = 0; i < number; i++){
            sumWeight += weights[i];
            maxWeight = Math.max(maxWeight,weights[i]);
        }
        int start = maxWeight;
        int end = sumWeight;
        while(start < end){
            int mid = start + (end - start) / 2;
            if(canBeTransfered(mid,days,weights)==true){
                end = mid;
            }
            else{
                start = mid + 1;
            }
        }
        return end;
    }
    
    boolean canBeTransfered(int capacity, int D, int[] weights){
        int sum = 0;
        int day = 1;
        for(int i = 0; i < weights.length; i++){
            if(sum + weights[i] <= capacity){
                sum += weights[i];
            }
            else{
                day++;
                sum = weights[i];
            }
        }
        if(day <= D){
            return true;
        }
        return false;
    }
}
```
